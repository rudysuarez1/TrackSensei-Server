# Security Roadmap

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (1-2 Weeks)
1. **Implement HTTPS**
   - Action: Ensure your application is served over HTTPS.
   - Details: Use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.

2. **Input Validation**
   - Action: Validate all incoming data using Pydantic models.
   - Details: Check for expected formats and types.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Action: Set up logging for authentication events.
   - Details: Log successful and failed login attempts, including timestamps and IP addresses. Consider using a logging library like loguru or Python's built-in logging module.

## Phase 2: Short-Term Goals (2-4 Weeks)
1. **Token Expiration and Refresh**
   - Action: Implement token expiration and a refresh token mechanism.
   - Details: Set a reasonable expiration time for access tokens (e.g., 15 minutes) and create a refresh token endpoint that allows users to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating.

2. **Secure Token Storage**
   - Action: Review and implement secure storage practices for tokens on the client side.
   - Details: If applicable, use secure cookies or local storage with appropriate security measures to store tokens.

3. **Enhance Token Security**
   - Action: Review and strengthen token signing and encryption.
   - Details: Ensure that JWTs are signed with a strong algorithm (e.g., RS256) and consider encrypting sensitive information within the token.

## Phase 3: Long-Term Enhancements (1-3 Months)
1. **Implement OAuth2**
   - Action: Consider implementing OAuth2 for third-party integrations.
   - Details: This will allow users to authenticate using external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) and delegate access without sharing passwords.

2. **Security Audits and Penetration Testing**
   - Action: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
   - Details: Hire external security experts or use automated tools to identify vulnerabilities in your application.

3. **User Education and Best Practice**
   - Action: Educate users about security best practices.
   - Details: Provide guidance on creating strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and securing their accounts.

4. **Regular Updates and Patch Management**
   - Action: Keep dependencies and libraries up to date.
   - Details: Regularly check for updates to your dependencies and apply security patches promptly.
