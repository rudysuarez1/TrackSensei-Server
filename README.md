# üèéÔ∏è TrackSensei Server üèéÔ∏è

This is the backend server for the TrackSensei system. It is built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL to handle user lap uploads, session management, and telemetry analysis.

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies with Poetry

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TrackSensei-Server.git
cd TrackSensei-Server
```

#### Running on macOS:

Install Python and Poetry:

```bash
brew install python

# Intel Macs:
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | /usr/local/bin/python3

# Apple Silicon (M1/M2):
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
```

Then install project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### 2. Setup PostgreSQL locally using Homebrew

Install and start PostgreSQL:

```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

Create the development database and user:

```bash
createdb tracksensei_dev
createuser -P tracksensei_user
```

Then, connect to PostgreSQL shell and grant privileges:

```sql
psql tracksensei_dev

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tracksensei_dev TO tracksensei_user;
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy and edit the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update your `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tracksensei_user:yourpassword@localhost/tracksensei_dev
```

## ‚úÖ Pre-commit and Code Quality

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

Run all code quality checks manually:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
poetry run pyright
poetry run pytest
poetry run pytest --cov
```

Or run them all together:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files && poetry run pyright && poetry run pytest
```

```bash
poetry run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

## API Documentation

This API is built using FastAPI, which provides automatic interactive API documentation.

### Accessing Swagger UI

You can access the Swagger UI to explore and test the API endpoints by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Accessing ReDoc

For a more visually appealing documentation interface, you can also access ReDoc at:

```
http://localhost:8000/redoc
```

### Using the Documentation

- **Swagger UI**: This interface allows you to view all available endpoints, their parameters, and response formats. You can also test the endpoints directly from the UI.
- **ReDoc**: This interface provides a structured view of the API documentation, making it easy to read and understand.

Make sure your FastAPI application is running before accessing these URLs.
